# Typescript

- A strongly typed language for JS developers which is superset of javascript and adds optional static typing to the language.
- Typescript by default converts ts code to es3 js code.
- If you want to overlap es3 version then you can run

  ```
    tsc index.ts --target es2015

  ```

- Compile file in another dir.

  ```
  tsc index.ts --outDir dist
  ```
