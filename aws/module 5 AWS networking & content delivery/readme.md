### Amazon VPC
    - Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service that lets you create and manage a private network within the AWS cloud. You can define your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, gateways, and security settings. VPCs allow you to securely connect your AWS resources, like EC2 instances, in a virtual environment isolated from other networks, making it easier to control traffic flow and enhance security.
